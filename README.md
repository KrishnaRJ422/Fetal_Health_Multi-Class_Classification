Here deep learning approach is used to classify fetal health to three discreet classes 'Normal', 'Suspect' and 'Pathological'.
Steps:
EDA
Missing value check
Outlier check
Feature scaling using robust scaler
Multicollinearity check using correlation plot
Mutual information classifier for dimensionality reduction
Model building
Evaluation
Explaining results using shap and lime methods.
