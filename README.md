# Fetal_Health_Multi-Class_Classification
Here deep learning approach is used to classify fetal health to three discreet classes 'Normal', 'Suspect' and 'Pathological'.
Steps:
EDA,
Multicollinearity check using correlation plot,
Missing value check,
Outlier check,
Mutual information classifier for dimensionality reduction,
Oversampling,
Target encoding,
Feature scaling using robust scaler,
Model building,
Saving the model,
Evaluation,
Explaining results using shap and lime methods.
